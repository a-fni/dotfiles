# dotfiles

Custom Arch Linux dotfiles.

## Overview

This repository contains most of the dotfiles used in my custom Arch Linux environment. These include:
- `.vimrc` configuration file
- `.bashrc` and `.config/basrch/*` configuration files for aliases, `PS1` and shell environment
- Dolphin, KDE, Konsole, ... custom configurations that it might be desired to vesion and/or replicate on future machines

These configuration files are currently in use on the following setup:
- Arch Linux x86\_64
- `bash` shell, emulated by **Konsole** terminal
- **Wayland** window manager
- **KDE Plasma** desktop environment
- **Dolphin** file explorer
